      <h1>Ultra</h1>

      <p>Ultra is the photo project that I have been working on for the past year but in reality, this has been over 10 years in the making.

      <p>Back in the summer of 2007, my mother and I met a group of runners at Boundary Waters, a local park in Douglasville, Georgia with different hiking trails. Without really doing much running before then, I wore one of my old t-shirts, a pair of jean shorts and my rather worn-out tennis shoes. The Georgia heat coupled with probably not being be in the best of shape kept us behind the pack of runners, but sure enough, my mom and I kept coming back to those meet ups and pushed ourselves a little further every time.</p>

      <p>Fast forward to November of 2011 and we would be running our first ever ultra. For those unaware of what an ultra is, an ultra qualifies as any distance over marathon distance (26.2 miles). In this case, our ultra was a 50K (31 miles) in Peachtree City, Georgia. My mother was a bit smarter than me and ran a marathon in March of 2011 before this race to really know what she was getting into with becoming an ultra runner, but I had not a clue since the farthest I ran before this race was 20 miles back in August. Nonetheless, the two of us finished. Four years into this running journey, we both completed our first 50K that if you had asked us five years earlier if we would ever do that, we probably would have fell over laughing.</p>

      <p>We kept running, pushing ourselves here and there to see how far we could really go, always joking around at the possibility of doing a 100 miler. Until it actually came into fruition. In 2018, my mother fully committed to training for the Pistol Ultra in Alcoa, Tennessee, where she would attempt to run 100 miles. And I knew I had to document it.</p>

      <p>Now, until you have seriously trained for an ultra, and I mean dedicating probably 50% or more of your time to it, it is really hard to comprehend what it takes. My mother and I have been in the ultra community for over 10 years. While we did not officially become ultra runners until 2011, we were at countless ultras all around our area, volunteering, crewing, helping in any shape or form to make the race go smoothly and assisting the runners however we can. Even with all of this AND the hundreds of miles my mother put into preparing for this race, we really did not know what was coming.</p>

      <p>When I started this project, I thought it would be a full documentation of my mother running this 100 miler, being there for every second, capturing every moment. But I wasn’t able to. Even though I’ve seen it countless times, even though it was a small thought in the back of my mind, I wasn’t, and neither was my mother, ready for if she didn’t finish.</p>


      <p>70 miles.</p>


      <p>My mother ran 70 miles.</p>


      <p>There is no way to describe the heartbreaking moment when we all realized she wouldn’t be able to finish but there is also no way to describe how unbelievably proud of her we all were for running 70 miles. She set so many PRs that day and conquered so much that making it to that point could only be seen as an accomplishment and far from a failure.</p>

      <p>Going back through all of these images after Pistol and all my other race images made me realize what I really wanted this project to be. I wanted to be able to have a visual representation for what an ultra is, what it really means to be an ultra runner.</p>

      <p>It’s not just about the distance, or the time at the end of the race.</p>

      <p>It’s early mornings, hours before the sun will rise. It’s maneuvering through state parks in the dark looking for the flags and signs pointing you to race parking. It’s bright eyed volunteers who have been awake just as long as you, if not earlier. It’s the race director corralling the 100 or so crazy enough to run a trail ultra to the starting line. It’s the rush of exhilaration you have at the start of the race before you settle into your breathing. It’s the quiet of the morning woods as runners get farther apart on the trails, finding their own race pace.</p>

      <p>It’s the waiting at aid stations for the first runners to come through, double checking all your supplies, filling water cups, slicing bananas. It’s the encouragement from the volunteers to keep moving when you’d really just like to have a seat in one of their lawn chairs. It’s the release of your swollen hands and fingers after you refill your water bottle, have some chips, maybe even a chunk of boiled potato dipped in salt.</p>

      <p>It’s running alone, or in a group. Running silently or mustering enough breath to have a full conversation. It’s wondering if you’re taking too long, or not long enough. It’s understanding if you’re pushing yourself to a burnout or falling past the cut off point.</p>

      <p>It’s tripping over your own feet, rocks, branches. It’s slipping in mud, snow, ice. It’s being covered in sweat, dirt, blood, bruises.</p>

      <p>It’s wanting the race to be over, and knowing you have all the capabilities of making it to the end.</p>

      <p>It’s the cheer of other runners, friends, volunteers, as you make it to the finish line. It’s the relief your legs have of not having to take another step. It’s the clink of beer bottles as you congratulate others and have a celebratory drink.</p>

      <p>It’s all of this and so much more. It’s not a team but it is a community. The ultra running community is incredible and even with not being able to be as involved as I used to be, I know I’m always welcome back.</p>

      <p>I hope to continue to document other ultra running communities and who knows, maybe even attempt a 100 miler myself.</p>
